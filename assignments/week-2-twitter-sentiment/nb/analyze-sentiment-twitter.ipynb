    "A quick read of the above results, comparing *distil_sentiment* & *bert_sentiment*, suggests that *bert_sentiment* did much better (I agreed with most of *bert's* labels):\n",
    "- Adding a 'Neutral' class in *bert* pulled ~80% of tweets labeled as 'Negative' by *distil_sentiment* into 'Neutral' (40/51). About 50% of tweets labeled as 'Positive' by *destil_sentiment* were re-classified as 'Neutral' (24/49). \n",
    "- Still, the default *distilbert* model got most of the *POSITIVE* and *NEGATIVE* tweets right i.e., few of the tweets re-classified by *bertweet* represented *a switch to the opposite sentiment, viz.* from *POS to NEG* (only 1/49) or *NEG to POS* (only 5/64).\n",
    "- Not surprisingly, *Distilbert* had trouble with *NEUTRAL* tweets (having no place to put these!). In this sample, it seems to prefer labeling these as *NEGATIVE*. \n",
    "- ***Adding the NEUTRAL label appears to significantly improve results compared with forcing the restrictive binary output of distilbert.***\n",
    "\n",
    "Of relevance, Hugging Face notes that *distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english* was fine-tuned on SST-2, a corpus of >10K single sentences extracted from movie reviews. In addition, *distilbert* is intended to be fine-tuned on a downstream task (in this case, tweets), although its precision, recall, accuracy, & F1 metrics approach 99% when tested against subsets of the SST-2 data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, Hugging Face's *bertweet-base-sentiment-analysis* model was trained on a 2017 corpus of ~40K tweets, presumably much more similar to our sample than *distilbert's* movie reviews. Together with the addition of a 3rd *NEUTRAL* class, this may help explain *bertweet's* superior performance here. (NB: When reviewing the above data, *bertweet* at times creates the impression of having a rather un-machine-like, nuanced 'understanding' of Elon's tweets!)"

Nonetheless, both models show generalizability beyond their respective training domains, as suggested by the small sample of 'difficult tweets' above, which also included e.g. non-tweets: short phrases in other languages, common email signoffs (e.g. 'Best regards,'), informational text, proverbs/aphorisms, and poetry."
